        Up to JDK 1.0.1, private and protected keywords could be used together to create yet another form of protection which used to act as a restriction to methods or variables mainly to subclasses of a given class. In JDK 1.0.2, this capability has been removed.</td>

        Scripting Language Support, 
        Generic API for tight integration with scripting languages,
